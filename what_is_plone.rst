What is Plone
=============

Plone is many things to many people. Here is what I think it is, followed by what other people think it is [1]_, followed by comments from the public (where you may add what you think it is [2]_).

.. Note::

    I have more than one definition. But TL;DR:

    Plone is an open source web content management system written in Python. It is developed and supported by a worldwide community of hundreds of "Plone companies" as well as individual volunteers. It is used by thousands of organizations and individuals all over the world, in every professional sector imaginable (e.g. business, government, non-profit, etc.)

My Definition(s)
----------------

As said above, Plone is many things to many people. So what is it to me? Here are a few definitions I like:

- **Plone is a CMS web application written in Python.**

But then you have to explain "CMS". So how about:

- **Plone is a web content management system written in Python.**

I like this one, except the concept of "CMS" (content management system) is a bit dated. So how about:

- **Plone is a web application that makes it easy to build a public-facing or private intranet website.**

The above is nice, but not altogether true. If Plone were entirely a hosted application with one click installable themes (e.g. ploud.com) then it would be closer to true. The reason the above statement is not entirely true (as we'd like it to be marketing-wise) is complicated and will not be addressed here [3]_.

Spin
~~~~

Of course, I like a good spin:

- **Plone is the best available Python-based web content management system available, hands down.**

While I firmly believe the above to be true, I don't always lead with that definition, because I'm sure there are others that believe the same about their Python-based CMS of choice (e.g. Django CMS).

Community
~~~~~~~~~

One thing I don't mind leading with, and standing behind amidst all the competition:

- **Plone has the best community of any open source community you will ever find, anywhere, ever.**

I'm not entirely sure how this came to be, and it could just be my bias, but: I'm loosely a member of at least a half dozen such communities and am always blown away by how this particular community conducts itself. The reason the above statement is true is complicated and will not be addressed here [3].

Other Definitions
-----------------

- From plone.org, a "state-of-the-art open source CMS."

.. [1] More accurately, what I think other people think it is.

.. [2] Good or bad, your comments are welcome as long as they are courteous.

.. [3] Yet, but maybe at some point in the future.
