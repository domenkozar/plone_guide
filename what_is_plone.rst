What is Plone
=============

Plone is many things to many people. Here I define what I think it is, followed by what other people think it is [1]_, followed by comments from the public (where you may add what you think it is [2]_).

.. Note::

    I have more than one definition. But for the TL;DR crowd: Plone is an open source web content management system written in Python and developed, supported, and used by 

My Definition(s)
----------------

As said above, Plone is many things to many people. So what is it to me? Here are a few definitions I like:

- **Plone is a CMS web application written in Python.**

But then you have to explain "CMS". So how about:

- **Plone is a web content management system written in Python.**

I like this one, except the concept of "CMS" (content management system) is a bit dated. So how about:

- **Plone is a web application that makes it easy to build a public-facing or private intranet website.**

The above is nice, but not altogether true. If Plone were entirely a hosted application with one click installable themes (e.g. ploud.com) then it would be closer to true. The reason the above statement is not entirely true (as we'd like it to be marketing-wise) is complicated and will not be addressed here [3]_.

Other Definitions
-----------------

- From plone.org, a "state-of-the-art open source CMS."

.. [1] More accurately, what I think other people think it is.

.. [2] Good or bad, your comments are welcome as long as they are courteous.

.. [3] Yet, but maybe at some point in the future.
