Why Choose Plone?
=================

In my case, I came to Plone first then Python [1]_. However I'm now interested in bringing folks to Plone through Python. So let's have some fun and take the definition of Python from python.org [2]_ and replace it with Plone:

.. Note::

    Plone is a web application that lets you work more quickly and create web content more effectively. You can learn to use Plone and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.

In other words, one reason you may choose Plone is you get to write Python code and writing Python code is fun and satisfying [3]_.

.. [1] By building this website with Plone circa early 2000s: http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/.

.. [2] Via python.org: "Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs."

.. [3] Plone is 10+ years old so not all of the code is fun to deal with. However this guide as well as documentation from the project itself (e.g. http://developer.plone.org/) aim to help you avoid any pain points. Or if you encounter them, help successfully navigate you through.
