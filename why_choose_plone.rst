Why Choose Plone?
=================

In my case, I came to Plone first then Python [1]_. However today, I'm mostly interested in bringing folks to Plone through Python. So let's have some fun and take the definition of Python from python.org [2]_ and replace it with Plone:

.. Note::

    Plone is a web application that lets you work more quickly and create web content more effectively. You can learn to use Plone and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs.

.. [1] By building this website with Plone circa early 2000s: http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/.

.. [2] Via python.org: "Python is a programming language that lets you work more quickly and integrate your systems more effectively. You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in productivity and lower maintenance costs."
